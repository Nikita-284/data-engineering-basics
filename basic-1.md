## 🔍 **1. What is Data Engineering?**

* Builds infrastructure to **collect, clean, transform, and deliver** data at scale.
* Prepares data for **analytics**, **BI**, and **machine learning**.
* Different from data analytics (which focuses on interpreting data) and traditional integration (which just moves data without transforming or scaling).

---

## 💡 **2. Use Cases at Big Tech (Meta, Google, Amazon)**

* **Meta**: Real-time clickstream for recommendations.
* **Google**: Data pipelines feeding ML models.
* **Amazon**: Demand forecasting using event-based data pipelines.
* Supports **streaming, ML**, and **automated dashboards** — goes far beyond static reporting.

---

## 🧠 **3. How AI is Influencing Data Engineering**

* Auto data validation (e.g., anomaly detection)
* Code generation (SQL, transformations)
* ML-driven pipeline optimization
* Entity resolution, schema mapping
* **Natural language queries** and **self-healing pipelines**

---

## 📈 **4. Why Data Engineering is Growing Rapidly**

* Explosion in data volume & cloud adoption
* Rise of ML/AI — needs clean, fast data
* Modern data stack (dbt, Fivetran, Snowflake)
* Real-time demands → Kafka, Flink
* Data is now a **product**; not just support

---

## 🔁 **5. Is Data Engineering Just Scaled Integration?**

* Related, but broader:

  * Traditional = move data from A → B
  * DE = build **scalable, automated, governed pipelines**
  * Involves **metadata, lineage, streaming, ML readiness**

---

## 🆚 **6. Data Engineering vs System Design**

* **System Design** = Serving user requests (e.g., messaging apps)
* **Data Engineering** = Preparing data for analytics, ML, reports
* Uses similar tools (Kafka, shards), but purpose differs:

  * System = speed, availability
  * DE = clean, trustable data at scale

---

## 🧰 **7. Tools and Tech Stack for Expert-Level DE**

* **Languages**: Python, SQL, Scala
* **Frameworks**: Spark, Flink, dbt
* **Orchestration**: Airflow, Dagster, Databricks Jobs
* **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure
* **Data Lakes**: S3, Delta Lake
* **Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
* **Monitoring**: Great Expectations, Monte Carlo
* **ML Integration**: MLflow, Feature Store

## 📦 **8. DB vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake**

| Type               | Use                    | Example             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Database**       | Transactional (OLTP)   | MySQL, MongoDB      |
| **Data Warehouse** | Analytics (OLAP)       | Snowflake, Redshift |
| **Data Lake**      | Raw, unstructured data | S3, Azure Data Lake |

---

## 🔥 **9. What is Spark / PySpark?**

* **Spark**: Distributed engine for big data processing.
* **PySpark**: Python API for Spark (runs on JVM).
* Python alone can't scale for TBs — Spark parallelizes across clusters.

---

## 🧱 **10. What is Databricks?**

* Unified **cloud platform** for Spark + ML + SQL.
* Not a language — runs **on AWS, Azure, or GCP**.
* Handles **infrastructure**, **clusters**, **pipelines**, **ML models**, and **collaboration**.
* Supports data access via S3, GCS, JDBC, etc.
* Pay via **DBUs (Databricks Units)** + cloud compute.

---

## 🔄 **11. Is Databricks an Orchestration Tool?**

* Yes — supports:

  * **Job chaining with dependencies**
  * **Schedules + retries**
  * **Delta Live Tables** for declarative pipelines
  * ML pipeline orchestration via **MLflow**

## 🏁 **12. Competitors of Databricks**

| Area              | Competitor                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Lakehouse         | **Snowflake**, BigQuery, Microsoft Fabric |
| ETL               | Airflow, Dagster, Fivetran, Prefect       |
| ML                | SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML            |
| Stream Processing | Apache Flink, Kafka Streams               |
| Standalone Spark  | EMR, GCP Dataproc                         |
